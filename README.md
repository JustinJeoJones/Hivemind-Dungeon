# Boot.dev Hackathon

# Hivemind-Dungeon
A game for streamers made to get interaction from their chat. Connect it to your twitch channel and your viewers can join as goblins to fight in the dungeon. 
This is in super early development phase and needs more work still to be complete. 

# How to use
Just pull down the repo. Inside is a folder called Hivemind Game, and then Hivemind Dungeon.exe will launch it.
